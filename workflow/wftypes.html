<p class="title">Adding New Workflow Types: Overview</p>
<p class="body">You add new workflow types to Content Server when you 
want to define the set of custom operations that are applied to a 
workflow map definition when a Content Server user chooses 
to create that particular type of workflow. These custom operations 
can include adding workflow steps, modifying the duration or name of 
existing workflow steps, adding callback scripts to workflow events,
or any other modifications.</p>

<p class="body">The workflows types that you create can be 
simple or complex, depending on your workflow requirements. 
For example, you can create a workflow type that appends the
current date to the title of a workflow in Content Server, or you can 
create a workflow type that runs a callback script when the 
workflow is complete. You can create many different
types of workflows &#151; each of which performs different 
custom operations. The custom operations that you define for a 
workflow type are applied to a workflow's map definition
just before a user initiates a workflow map of that type.</p>

<p class="body">When you add a new type of workflow to Content Server, 
the <span class="gui">Workflow Type</span> list appears on
the General Properties page tab of a workflow map. 
The <span class="gui">Workflow Type</span> list allows the
creators of workflow maps to choose which type of workflow to create.</p>
