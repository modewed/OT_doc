<p class="title">Introduction to Content Server Workflow Functionality</p>
<p class="body">Content Server Workflow is a preinstalled, optional Content Server module 
that allows Content Server users to create and manage workflows in Content Server.  
Workflows are business processes that follow 
sequential paths from start to completion, and automate procedures that 
have a series of defined steps.</p>
<p class="body">For example, a user can define a workflow that runs each time a user submits an 
expense report.  During execution of this workflow, Content Server might route the 
document to a manager or supervisor for approval, and then to the company's 
Accounting department for payment. Content Server Workflow can 
create simple or complex workflows, depending on the business processes a Content Server
user wants to automate.</p>
<p class="body">You can extend Content Server's workflow functionality by creating 
new task types, data types, workflow types, and event trigger scripts that work
with the existing Content Server Workflow module. When you extend Content Server's workflow 
functionality in this way, you create a separate, custom module to store
the new objects you need for the extended functionality.
Do not alter the original Content Server Workflow module. If you do, future upgrades 
to Content Server or the Content Server Workflow module will overwrite your changes.
See <a href="custom.html">Creating a Custom Module</a>, or the Module 
Development Guide, for instructions on creating a new module in the Builder.</p>

<span id="wfroute" class="title2">Workflows, Workflow Paths, and Work Packages</span>
<p class="body"><span class="emph">Workflows</span> are business processes that 
follow sequential paths from start to completion.
The sequential paths of defined steps are called 
<span class="emph">workflow paths</span>. 
Some steps in a workflow path are tasks that
particular Content Server users or groups are responsible for completing. 
Other steps execute automatically, including Milestone steps, which 
track workflow and workflow task due dates, and Sub-workflow steps,
which initiate other workflow processes within the main workflow.</p>

<p class="body">When a workflow is initiated, Content Server analyzes the first 
step and routes the corresponding task to the Tasks page of the Content Server 
user or group to which it is assigned.  When that task is complete, 
Content Server repeats the analysis for
each step in the workflow until the workflow is complete.</p>

<p class="body">Content Server users view the workflow tasks assigned to them
on their Personal Assignments page.
<p class="body">The data associated with each Content Server workflow 
that travels along the workflow route is stored in the 
<span class="emph">work package</span>. 
Work packages, by default, can include the attachments (for
example, documents and other Content Server items), attributes, and comments. 
The workflow designer defines attributes to
store and track information throughout the workflow. Workflow
participants, depending on the workflow step settings, may examine
and specify new values for workflow attributes at each 
workflow step.
The workflow designer also sets whether users can view or modify comments, which
are instructions or notes that can be added by workflow 
participants as they complete their task assignments.</p>

<p class="body">In Content Server, each workflow is saved as a workflow map.  
<span class="emph">Workflow maps</span> contain the workflow route, along with
all other information associated with a workflow and its steps.  The workflow map 
is instantiated as an executing workflow each time a user initiates a workflow.</p>

<span id="wfroles" class="title2">Workflow Roles</span>
<p class="body">Workflow roles define the responsibilities and 
capabilities that particular Content Server
users and groups have in a workflow. Content Server
users can have four roles:
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body">The <span class="emph">creator</span> adds 
	the workflow map to Content Server, 
	paints it, and defines its work package
	<li class="body">The <span class="emph">initiator</span> initiates the 
	workflow map, starting a workflow process
	<li class="body">The <span class="emph">participant</span> 
	completes tasks, modifying the work package if necessary
	<li class="body">The <span class="emph">manager</span> monitors 
	the status of a workflow on the Workflow Status page, 
	and usually has the authority to modify,
	suspend, resume, or stop a workflow after it is initiated
</ul>

<span id="wfpainter" class="title2">The Workflow Designer</span>
<p class="body">The workflow creator <span class="emph">paints</span> a 
graphical representation of a workflow process with Content Server's 
Java-based Workflow Designer. The Workflow Designer provides a drag-and-drop
interface for defining the workflow route and work package using icons. It 
contains the Step Palette and the Zoom View, and 
is located on the Map Editor page in Content Server.</p>

<p class="body">The Step Palette contains icons that represent the 
different types of steps that users can add to the workflow map they design with 
the Workflow Designer.</p>

<p class="body">When workflow creators make a workflow map in the 
Workflow Designer, they define a work package that contains the data that 
the workflow participants require to complete their task assignments.</p>
<p class="body">On the Workflow Properties page, workflow creators can:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body">Define general information associated with the 
	workflow map, such as its title and description.</li>
	<li class="body">Define the manager or management group responsible 
	for monitoring and updating the status and execution of the workflow map.</li>
	<li class="body">Select documents and other Content Server items 
	(for example, queries, URLs, forms, and spreadsheets) to include as 
	attachments in the work package.</li>
	<li class="body">Define attributes in the work package that store 
	information as a means of tracking and managing the work process and 
	that prompt for user input.</li>
	<li class="body">Define whether comments or other custom items 
	are included in the work package.
</ul>

<span class="title3">The Zoom View</span>
<p class="body">The Zoom View, the movable mini-map of the workflow, 
allows workflow creators to navigate a workflow map that is not entirely 
visible in the Workflow Designer. Instead of using the scroll bars to view a 
large map, they move the rectangular outline in the Zoom View to display the 
corresponding area of the Workflow Designer. Clicking an area in the Zoom View 
takes them to that place in the main map.</p>

<p class="body">The modifications made to a workflow map in the Workflow 
Painter are dynamically updated in the Zoom View. This is especially useful for
large maps that cannot be displayed on a single screen in the Workflow Designer.</p>


<span id="status" class="title2">Workflow Status</span>
<p class="body">Managers or initiators of a workflow can monitor the 
status of the workflow after it is initiated in Content Server. The Workflow Status 
page displays the title, status, step information, due date, and relationship 
associated with the active workflows in Content Server.</p>
