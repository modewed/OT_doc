<p class="title">Introduction to Content Server Workflow Architecture</p>
<p class="body">A high-level extension of Content Server's workflow functionality 
requires an advanced understanding of the architecture and operation 
of the existing Content Server Workflow module.</p>

<p class="body">The functionality of the Content Server Workflow module 
is controlled by the Workflow Application Programming Interface (WAPI) 
and the OScript programming language. WAPI and OScript work together to 
create a robust workflow management system that provides advanced management 
tools and status control.</p>

<p class="body">The Content Server Workflow module is based on a combination 
of step types, data types, workflow types, and event trigger scripts. 
After you understand how these features work
in the main Content Server Workflow module, you can create your own 
module that extends their capabilities.</p>
<p class="body">In this section, you learn about:</p>

</ul>

<span id="wfarch" class="title2">Content Server Workflow Architecture</span>

<p class="body">The Content Server Workflow module lets you create and manage 
workflows in Content Server using the Workflow Application Programming Interface (WAPI) 
and the OScript programming language.</p>

<span class="title3">WAPI</span>
<p class="body">WAPI is an application programming interface that maintains 
a database of workflow maps <span class="emph">(maps)</span> and work 
packages <span class="emph">(work)</span>. Workflow maps define specific steps 
and the links that join those steps in a workflow. Work is created when a 
workflow map is initiated in Content Server and defines the work package that 
is routed through the workflow. WAPI also provides functions that you 
can use to query the database of workflow maps and work packages.</p>

<p class="body">WAPI is responsible for most of the database interaction 
involved in the creation and execution of Content Server workflows, including the 
maintenance of basic workflow information such as titles, due dates, and status. 
WAPI is also responsible for maintaining a complete audit trail.</p>

<span class="title3">OScript</span>
<p class="body"><span class="emph">OScript</span> is an object-oriented 
programming language that lets you develop and customize applications 
using the Content Server IDE. In Content Server, OScript is used to control 
the graphical user interface (GUI) for painting workflow maps and 
displaying task lists and step information to workflow participants.

<p class="body">OScript is used, along with Content Server's document 
management functionality, to store workflow maps as document nodes 
that can manipulate Content Server's extensive document management 
functionality (including permissions, version control, and attributes). 
Additionally, OScript almost completely handles the flow of data as it 
is routed through a workflow.</p>

<span id="wfstatus" class="title2">Using WAPI and OScript for Workflow Management and Status</span>
<p class="body">WAPI and OScript together manage the permissions that you can 
assign to workflow managers and the status of workflows in Content Server.</p>

<p class="body">The manager of a workflow monitors a workflow's status 
and may have the authority to modify, suspend, resume, or stop a workflow 
after it is initiated. WAPI lets the creator of a workflow map specify only 
one Content Server user or group as the workflow manager; however, OScript lets the 
creator of a workflow map establish different permission levels within a 
single management group. Because WAPI and OScript work together in this way, the
creator of a workflow map can specify a group of Content Server users as the manager 
of the workflow, and can then expand that group and assign different permission 
levels to the base group members and the workflow initiator.</p>

<p class="body">WAPI is responsible for calculating and maintaining all of the 
due dates and completed dates for a workflow, but tracks only the 
workflow status categories; OScript is responsible for 
defining the more detailed workflow status that is presented to workflow 
managers. Detailed status levels are determined by analyzing the due 
dates for a workflow and the steps it contains.</p>

<p class="body">Because detailed status levels are determined by OScript, 
OScript programmers can change the definition of the status levels or add 
new levels by overriding the script that defines them.</p>

<span class="title3">Storing Workflow Management and 
Status Information</span>

<p class="body">Workflow management and status information is stored in a table 
named WWork, located in the Content Server database.</p>

<p class="body">The rows in the WWork table contain specific workflow 
management information, such as due dates, milestone dates, permission 
settings, and status. For example, the WORK_DATECOMPLETED row contains 
the date on which the workflow was completed.</p>

<p class="body">Workflow management and status information for 
Sub-workflows is stored in a table named WSubWork in the Content Server database.</p>

<p class="body">The rows in the WSubWork table contain specific workflow 
management information, such as due dates, milestone dates, permission 
settings, and status for Sub-workflows. For example, the SUBWORK_DATECOMPLETED 
row contains the date on which the Sub-workflow
was completed.</p>
