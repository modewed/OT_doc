<p class="title">Adding New Data Types: Background Information</p>
<p class="body">
In this section, you learn how to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="body"> Define the data type's API object</p>
<li class="body"> Define the data type's Workflow Designer information</p>
<li class="body"> Define the information required to route the data type through a workflow</p>
<li class="body"> Add a new data type to your custom module</ul>
<p class="title">Defining the Data Type's API Object</p>
<p class="body">
You begin creating a data type by defining its API object using the 
<span class="code">WFDataTypes</span> object. This object contains the 
features and scripts that are required for the operation of the data
type. You can find the 
<span class="code">WFDataTypes</span> object to orphan in 
<span class="code">WFMain:WFRoot:WFObjectTypes</span>.</p>

<p class="body">The <span class="code">WFDataTypes</span> object acts as 
a class object that you use to create many different data types. 
Create a child of the <span class="code">WFDataTypes</span> object for 
each data type that you want to add to Content Server.

<p class="body">For each data type API object that you create, you can modify the 
following features.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fDataName</span>, which
	 stores the name of the custom tab that 
	appears in the Content Server interface when you create a new data type.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fSubType</span>, which stores a unique 
	integer that works with 
	the <span class="code">fType</span> feature to identify the object.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fType</span>, which stores a unique integer 
	that works with the 
	<span class="code">fSubType</span> feature to identify the object.
</ul>

<dl class="body">
	<dt><span class="gui">Note:</span><dd> When adding data types, set
	the <span class="code">fSubType</span> 	values to 1 and the 
	<span class="code">fType</span> 
	values to an integer higher than 100. Values between 1 and 99 are reserved for 
	Open Text internal use.</dl>

<p class="body">In addition to the features and scripts that you modify to 
define the Workflow Designer information for a data type, you must create 
the HTML file that appears when a map creator defines the data type information 
for each workflow task. </p>

<p class="body">
To support the transport capabilities for your custom workflow packages is optional and can be achieved by implementing the
already mentioned functions <span class="code">GetXmlMetaData(), PrepareXmlMetaData(), SetXmlMetaData()</span> resp. the functions
<span class="code">GetXmlMetaDataTask(), PrepareXmlMetaDataTask(), SetXmlMetaDataTask()</span> for the package specific task data. 
With these implementations you ensure that the metadata is exported from the source environment while adding the workflow map to
the Transport Warehouse and imported while it is deployed in the target environment. But the key feature of Content Server Transport 
is the ability to map external references during the transport. The most obvious external references that exist in a workflow map
are the users and groups that are used for step assignment. But also folders and documents differ at least in their id from one
system to another. In order to map these references during the transport you have to implement <span class="code">dependency, dependency
finder and dependency replacer</span> objects. You can refer to the different objects that are already implement in the workflow modules or 
you check out the <span class="code">TRANSPORT</span> module which provides the basic transport functionality and the parent objects to
orphan you objects from.</p>

<p class="body">
See package <span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport</span> for the workflow related dependency objects. As an example to maintain a sub
workflow reference of the sub-workflow step, the following three objects where introduced:
<ul type="disc">
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependency</span> that identifies a dependency to a workflow map
    used as sub workflow.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependencyFinder</span> used to find sub workflow related metadata in
    the export file and to display the dependency in the transport warehouse.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependencyReplacer</span> used to replace the sub workflow related
    metadata during the import.</p>
</ul>
</p>


<p class="title">Defining the Data Type's Web Object</p>
<p class="body">
After you define the API object and the Workflow Designer information for the data type,
you must define the data type's Web object. The Web object provides the information
necessary to handle the data type when workflow participants manipulate its data in
executing workflows. You define this information using the 
<span class="code">WFPackage</span> object. You can
find this object to orphan in <span class="code">WebWork:WebWorkRoot</span>.</p>
