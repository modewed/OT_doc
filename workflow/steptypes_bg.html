<p class="title">Adding New Step Types: Background Information</p>

<a name="backapi"><span class="title2">Defining the step Type's API Object</span></a>
<p class="body">
You begin creating a step type by defining its API object. This object 
contains features and scripts that are required for the operation 
of a workflow step type and is named <span class="code">StandardTasks</span>. 
You can find the <span class="code">StandardTasks</span> object in 
<span class="code">WFMain:WFRoot:WFObjectTypes:WFTaskTypes</span>.

<p class="body">The <span class="code">StandardTasks</span> object 
acts as a class object that you can use to create many different step types.
You can also access the <span class="code">StandardTasks</span> object using 
the Content Server API. For more information, see the <a href="../lapi/frameset.html">Content Server API Developer's 
Reference</a>.</p>

<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the 
following features:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fSubType</span> stores a unique integer 
	value that works with the fType feature to identify the object.
	The <span class="code">WFTask</span> object and the 
	<span class="code">WFTask</span> object also contain fSubType features, which
	must be the same as the value of this <span class="code">fSubType</span> feature.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fTaskName</span> stores the name of the step. By default, 
	this value is displayed when you position your cursor over the task's 
	icon in the Workflow Designer.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fType</span> stores a unique integer 
	value that works with the <span class="code">fSubType</span> feature 
	to identify the object.
</ul>

<p class="body">When adding step types, set the <span class="code">fType</span> 
values to an integer higher than 99 and the <span class="code">fSubType</span> 
values to an integer between 1 and 10.</p>

<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the 
following scripts:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetPainterInfo()</span> retrieves the text that is displayed 
	as a title below the step icon in the Workflow Desinger. The default value is 
	the title of the step, as specified in the <span class="code">fTaskName</span> 
	feature.  If you do not want to display the title of the step in the
	Workflow Designer, you can modify this script.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">ReadyTaskForInitiation()</span> stores callback scripts and 
	any additional data that is required by the step type throughout 
	the execution of a workflow. This script is called when the workflow is initiated.
	You can use this script to store the type, subtype, and
	permission information for the step type in the
	MAPTASK_USERDATA column of the WMapTask table. The
	type and subtype information must be present in the
	WMapTask table so that Content Server can distinguish between
	different types of tasks.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">SetTaskDefaults()</span> stores the default data that must be 
	present before Content Server can recognize the step type (that is, the type and subtype). This
	script also stores the title, performer ID, and any other
	information that you want to appear as default values on the
	Step Definition page when a step of this type is edited in
	Content Server.  You can also use this script to store step information that must
	be present if the creator of a workflow map does not edit the
	step on the Step Definition page before the workflow is
	initiated.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">SetTaskRecFromMap()</span> converts a workflow step that has 
	been prepared for initiation to a workflow map definition step. This script 
	transfers data from the <span class="code">WAPIMAPTASK</span> to the correct 
	fields in the map definition step to convert the workflow step back to a format
	that the Workflow Designer recognizes.  The <span class="code">WAPIMAPTASK
	</span> data type is used to define the object handle of a workflow map step 
	that is stored in the WAPI database. It is used in WAPI functions for all 
	step manipulation operations.
	This script is called when a workflow manager attempts to
	modify a workflow that has already been initiated. It undoes the
	changes that were made by the <span class="code">ReadyTaskForInitiation()</span>
	script (because the <span class="code">ReadyTaskForInitiation()</span> script is called
	again when the workflow manager saves their changes and the
	workflow process is resumed).
</ul>

<a name="backpaint"><span class="title2">Defining the Workflow Designer Information</span></a>
<p class="body">
After you define the step type's API object, you must provide the Workflow 
Painter with the information it requires to display the step and manipulate 
the data provided by the creator of the workflow map. You define the Workflow 
Painter information using the <span class="code">WFTask</span> object. 
You can find this object in <span class="code">WebWFP:WebWFPRoot</span>.</p>

<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the following 
features:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fSubType</span> stores a unique integer 
	value that works with the fType feature to identify the object.
	The <span class="code">StandardTask</span> object and the 
	<span class="code">WFTask</span> object also contain fSubType features, which
	must be the same as the value of this <span class="code">fSubType</span> feature.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fType</span> stores a unique integer 
	value that works with the <span class="code">fSubType</span> feature 
	to identify the object.
</ul>

<p class="body">When adding step types, set the <span class="code">fType</span> 
values to an integer higher than 99 and the <span class="code">fSubType</span> 
values to an integer between 1 and 10.</p>

<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the following 
scripts:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetMapData()</span> tells Content Server what to display when the creator 
	of a workflow map edits this type of step. This script identifies the location 
	and name of the HTML file to display for the Step Definition page for this step 
	type. You can maintain consistency with other Content Server Step Definition
	pages by using the commonedittask.html file.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">PutMapData()</span> saves the information that the creator of a 
	workflow map enters on the Step Definition page when editing the step in the 
	Workflow Designer. This data is saved in the workflow map definition.
</ul>

<p class="body">In addition to the features and scripts that you modify to 
define the Workflow Designer information for a step type, you must create the 
HTML file for this task's Step Definition page.</p>

<p class="body">If you want to support the transport capabilities of Content Server, you
must modify these additional scripts that are executed while a workflow is transported 
from one system to another:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetXmlMetaDataSubclass()</span> adds step data that is relevant for
    the transport to the XML file that is written while the workflow map is added to the workbench.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">PrepareXmlMetaDataSubclass()</span> reads step data that is relevant 
    for the transport from the XML file while the workflow map is deployed from the workbench. Additionally it
    converts the data to a data structure that matches the step configuration.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">SetXmlMetaDataSubclass()</span> updates the existing workflow map step 
    configuration with the updated target system information.
</ul>

<p class="body">
To support the transport capabilities for your custom workflow packages is optional and can be achieved by implementing the
already mentioned functions <span class="code">GetXmlMetaData(), PrepareXmlMetaData(), SetXmlMetaData()</span> resp. the functions
<span class="code">GetXmlMetaDataTask(), PrepareXmlMetaDataTask(), SetXmlMetaDataTask()</span> for the package specific task data. 
With these implementations you ensure that the metadata is exported from the source environment while adding the workflow map to
the Transport Warehouse and imported while it is deployed in the target environment. But the key feature of Content Server Transport 
is the ability to map external references during the transport. The most obvious external references that exist in a workflow map
are the users and groups that are used for step assignment. But also folders and documents differ at least in their id from one
system to another. In order to map these references during the transport you have to implement <span class="code">dependency, dependency
finder and dependency replacer</span> objects. You can refer to the different objects that are already implement in the workflow modules or 
you check out the <span class="code">TRANSPORT</span> module which provides the basic transport functionality and the parent objects to
orphan you objects from.</p>

<p class="body">
See package <span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport</span> for the workflow related dependency objects. As an example to maintain a sub
workflow reference of the sub-workflow step, the following three objects where introduced:
<ul type="disc">
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependency</span> that identifies a dependency to a workflow map
    used as sub workflow.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependencyFinder</span> used to find sub workflow related metadata in
    the export file and to display the dependency in the transport warehouse.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">WEBWFP::Transport::SubmapDependencyReplacer</span> used to replace the sub workflow related
    metadata during the import.</p>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="backstat"><span class="title2">Defining the Status and Display of the Step</span></a>
<p class="body">
After you define the API object and Workflow Designer information for the step 
type, you must define the information that handles the step when a workflow 
participant is working on it and when it is displayed on the Detailed Status 
page in Content Server. You define this information using the 
<span class="code">WFTask</span> object. You can find this 
object in <span class="code">WebWork:WebWorkRoot</span>.</p>

<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the following 
features:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fPaletteTask</span> stores a Boolean value. If the value of this 
	feature is set to <span class="code">TRUE</span>, an icon
	representing the step type can be displayed on the Icon Palette in the
	Workflow Designer. If the value of this feature is set to 
	<span class="code">FALSE</span>, an icon representing the step type cannot 
	be displayed on the Step Palette in the Workflow Designer.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fSubType</span> stores a unique integer 
	value that works with the fType feature to identify the object.
	The <span class="code">StandardTask</span> object and the 
	<span class="code">WFTask</span> object also contain fSubType features which
	must be the same as the value of this <span class="code">fSubType</span> feature.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fTaskGif</span> stores the name of the image that was used until Content Server 10.5 to 
	represent the step on the Step Palette in the Workflow Designer. The image must be 32x32 pixels.
	This image must be stored in your module's support directory (for example,
	c:/opentext/module/<i>modulename</i><span class="code">_1_0_0</span>/support).</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fSmallTaskGif</span> stores the name of the image that is used to 
	represent the step on the Step Palette in the Workflow Designer of Content Server 10.5. It is added to the upper left corner of the BPMN 2.0 activity shape.
    The image must be 16x16 pixels. If it is not set the <span class="code">fTaskGif</span> image is used and scaled to this size.
	This image must be stored in your module's support directory (for example,
	c:/opentext/module/<i>modulename</i><span class="code">_1_0_0</span>/support).</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fType</span> stores a unique integer that works with the 
	<span class="code">fSubType</span> feature to identify the object.
</ul>

<p class="body">When adding step types, set the <span class="code">fType</span> 
values to an integer higher than 99 and the <span class="code">fSubType</span> 
values to an integer between 1 and 10.</p>


<p class="body">For each step type that you create, you can modify the 
following scripts:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetDisplayPerformerInfo()</span> examines the workflow and 
	determines if the step has been assigned to a workflow participant. 
	If it has, this script retrieves the name and ID of the workflow 
	participant to whom the step has been assigned. This information 
	is displayed when the workflow participant attempts to reassign 
	the step in Content Server.
	</p><li class="body"><span class="code">GetPainterInfo()</span> defines the information (for example, 
	the name, type, subtype, icon, or module) that the Workflow Designer 
	needs to know about the step type. This includes all of the information 
	that the Workflow Designer requires to perform operations on the step.
	</p><li class="body"><span class="code">GetPainterMenu()</span> returns a list of Assocs that define 
	the menu commands that appear when you right-click this step type's 
	icon in the Workflow Designer. You can set the Boolean value of the 
	<span class="code">viewonly</span> variable to <span class="code">
	TRUE</span> if you want to display a standard set of menu commands that do
	not let the creator of a workflow map edit the step type in the Workflow 
	Painter. You can set the Boolean value of the <span class="code">viewonly
	</span> variable to <span class="code">FALSE</span> if you want to display 
	a standard set of menu commands that let the creator of a workflow map edit
	the step type in the Workflow Designer. Whether you set the Boolean value of the 
	<span class="code">viewonly</span> variable to <span class="code">TRUE</span> 
	or <span class="code">FALSE</span>, you can use this script to override the 
	menu commands that are displayed in the Content Server interface as needed.
	</p><li class="body"><span class="code">GetStatusDisplay()</span> retrieves 
	the information that is 
	displayed when a workflow participant clicks the step name on the 
	Step List tab or double-clicks the step icon on the Map View tab of the 
	Detailed Status page. This script returns <span class="code">Undefined
	</span> (indicating that there is no information of this type relevant 
	to the active workflow) or it returns an Assoc. If the script returns an 
	Assoc, the fields in the Assoc must contain the information that the 
	HTML file (specified by <span class="code">retval.HTMLFile</span>) 
	needs to be displayed in Content Server. The Assoc contains OK if the data 
	needed for display is retrieved; otherwise, it contains a string named 
	<span class="code">ErrMsg</span>.
	</p><li class="body"><span class="code">GetTaskEditData()</span> retrieves 
	the information that is 
	displayed when a workflow participant clicks the step name on the Tasks 
	page in their Personal Workspace. This script returns <span class="code">
	Undefined</span> (indicating that there is no information of this type 
	relevant to the active workflow) or it returns an Assoc. If the function 
	returns an Assoc, the fields in the Assoc must contain the information 
	that the HTML file (specified by <span class="code">retval.HTMLFile</span>) 
	needs to be displayed in Content Server. The Assoc contains OK if the data needed 
	for display is retrieved; otherwise, it contains a string named 
	<span class="code">ErrMsg</span>.
	</p><li class="body"><span class="code">NewPerformer()</span> updates step information if the step is 
	reassigned in Content Server. For example, if the performer's name is also the 
	name of the step in the Workflow Designer, this script updates the names. 
	This script is called when this type of step is reassigned in Content Server so 
	that all performer-dependent information is updated.
</ul>

<p class="body">Depending on the complexity of the step types that you add to 
Content Server, you may have to provide additional functionality. For example, 
if you create a step type that allows the creators of workflow maps to 
attach custom callback scripts to particular workflow events that are 
associated with that step type, you may need to define the objects 
responsible for handling those callback scripts in Content Server. 
For more information, see the <a href="custom.html">WFCustomScriptPkg Object</a>.</p>

<p class="body">If you add a complex step type to the custom module that you are creating, you may need
to create custom request handlers that perform the operations associated with the step
type. For example, the form step type (installed with the Content Server Forms module) uses
request handlers to display the data in the form, to retrieve data from the form, and to
pass the data to the workflow. In this case, the request handlers set up and manipulate all
of the form's data correctly.</p>
