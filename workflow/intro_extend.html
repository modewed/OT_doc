<p class="title">Introduction to Extending Content Server Workflow</p>
<p class="body">Once you understand how the Content Server Workflow module operates 
within Content Server, you can begin to explore the possibilities for extending
Content Server's existing workflow functionality, such as:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><a href="#step">Adding new step types</a></li>
	<li class="body"><a href="#data">Adding new data types</a></li>
	<li class="body"><a href="#wf">Adding new workflow types</a></li>
	<li class="body"><a href="#event">Adding event trigger scripts</a></li>
</ul>

<span id="step" class="title2"><a href="steptypes.html">New Step Types</a></span>
<p class="body">One way to extend the functionality of Content Server workflow 
is to add new step types to the Step Palette. You add a new step type 
to Content Server when you want to customize the interface and operations presented 
to workflow participants for particular types of steps in a workflow, or when 
you want a new step that executes automatically within the workflow. When 
you add a new step type, you design the interface that is presented 
to the performer of a workflow step and you define the custom functionality 
that the new interface provides. You can create step types that require 
workflow participants to perform automated steps, such as filling out 
a form or sending a file to the printer or fax machine.</p>

<span id="wfsteps" class="title3">Understanding Step Types in Content Server Workflow</span>
<p class="body">To a Content Server user, workflows can include many different step 
types. To WAPI, all of the step types in a
workflow are essentially the same -- the difference is primarily determined 
by the values stored in the <span class="code">pFlags</span> attribute 
associated with each step.</p>
<p class="body">The <span class="code">pFlags</span> attribute controls the
behavior of the step. There are two optional values for the 
<span class="code">pFlags</span> <span class="code">FLAG_MILESTONE</span>. 
These values are stored in the MapTask_Flags column in the WMapTask table.</p>

<p class="body">The <span class="code">WAPI.MAPTASK_FLAG_AUTODONE</span> flag 
is a constant value that tells WAPI that the current step does not require 
user interaction and can be marked <span class="emph">finished</span> as soon 
as it becomes <span class="emph">ready</span>.</p>
<p class="body">The <span class="code">WAPI.MAPTASK_FLAG_MILESTONE</span> 
flag is a constant value that indicates to WAPI that the step should be 
marked as a Milestone step and that milestone dates should be calculated 
and stored. This flag also stores the milestone date (that is, the date 
by which the step is scheduled to be complete).</p>

<p class="body">Many of the step types that you define in a workflow map use callback 
scripts to perform their operations. For example, the <span class="gui">One Level 
Expand</span> and <span class="gui">Full Expand</span> options in the 
<span class="gui">Group Options</span> list for the Group step type use callback 
scripts to determine which workflow participants must work on the step. These options 
use a callback script to launch a Sub-workflow that assigns the step to the appropriate 
members of the group (depending on the option that you choose). The 
<span class="gui">Member Accept</span> option does not use a callback 
script to perform its function. It leaves the step assigned to a group. 
Content Server knows that when a step is assigned to an entire group, one member 
of the group must accept the step before work on the step can begin.</p>



<span id="data" class="title2"><a href="datatypes.html">New Data Types</a></span>
<p class="body">You add new data types to Content Server if you want to include 
new types of information in the work packages that accompany your workflows. 
By default, work packages can contain three data types: attachments, 
attributes, and comments; however, you can create a data
type for any new type of information that you want to add to a work 
package, even data not stored in the Content Server database. Adding new data 
types to Content Server also lets you customize the 
Content Server interface. For example, if the work packages that users include with 
workflows usually contain many attributes, you could create a data 
type that creates the attributes and groups them for convenience on tabs 
in the Content Server interface.</p>


<span class="title3">Understanding Data Types in Content Server Workflow</span>

<p class="body">The self-sufficient objects, which control the data that 
is routed in workflows know how to save, retrieve, and display their own data. 
In fact, a workflow only knows two things about the data it routes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body">Identifier information (type and subtype integers), which 
	allows the workflow to call scripts contained in the self-sufficient object</li></p>
	<li class="body">Information specified by the data type, which allows the object to access the correct data for the workflow</li>
</ul>

<span id="wf" class="title2"><a href="wftypes.html">New Workflow Types</a></span>
<p class="body">You can also extend the functionality of Content Server 
workflows by adding new workflow types to Content Server. You add new workflow 
types when you want to apply a particular set of custom operations to 
different workflow map definitions. Adding new workflow types lets you define 
the set of custom operations that are applied to a workflow map definition
when the creator of a workflow map chooses to create that particular type 
of workflow in Content Server. These custom operations can include adding 
workflow steps, modifying the duration or name of existing workflow steps, 
adding callback scripts to workflow events, or any other modification 
that you want to make to a workflow map definition.</p>

<span id="types" class="title3">Understanding Workflow Types in Content Server Workflow</span>
<p class="body">Content Server uses two different types of maps to create and 
process workflows: the Content Server Workflow Map, which is used for painting 
the workflow process, and the WAPIMAP, which is the route definition used by WAPI.</p>
<span class="title3">The Workflow Map</span>
<p class="body">The Content Server Workflow Map definition is recognized by the 
Workflow Designer and stored as a Record data type for easy manipulation 
with OScript. It contains fields that correspond to the WAPIMAP database 
table columns, and other fields that are used for temporary storage when 
the workflow map is being painted and before it is initiated.</p>

<p class="body">When a user creates a workflow map in Content Server, Content Server 
actually creates an empty document item. This empty document item is 
represented by a workflow map node in Content Server. A painted workflow map 
is stored as a Record data type. If a user saves the painted workflow map, 
the Record that represents the Content Server Workflow Map definition is added 
(in BLOB format) as a new version to the document item in Content Server. 
Each time the workflow map is modified and saved, a new version of 
the workflow map definition is saved in BLOBData.</p>

<p class="body">If the workflow map contains attachments 
(specified in the Attachments work package data type), an attachment 
folder is stored as a child of the workflow map node in Content Server.</p>

<p class="body">When a workflow map is opened in the Workflow Designer, 
a copy of the workflow map node is temporarily stored in a hidden folder. 
The changes that a workflow designer makes to a workflow map in the Workflow 
Painter are stored in the temporary copy of the workflow map node until saved. 
When the changes made in the Workflow Designer are saved, the temporary copy of 
the workflow map node is added to the original node as a new version. 
The temporary version of the workflow map node is stored in the Content Server
database for seven days, which allows you to return to a map that is in 
the process of being painted (but not yet saved).</p>

<span class="title3">The WAPIMAP</span>
<p class="body">When a Content Server user initiates a workflow map, the 
Content Server Workflow Map definition is used to create the WAPIMAP. The
 WAPIMAP stores the routing information that is used by WAPI to control 
 the workflow route. This map definition is stored in the WMap and WMapTask 
 database tables and is used throughout the life of the workflow.</p>

<p class="body">At the time of initiation, the Content Server Workflow Map and the 
WAPIMAP are completely separate. Any changes made to the painted Content Server 
Workflow Map do not affect the active workflows that were initiated from the 
Content Server Workflow Map definition. Similarly, any changes made to a 
 specific workflow's WAPIMAP after initiation do not affect the
Content Server Workflow Map.</p>

<span id="event" class="title2"><a href="eventtrigs.html">Custom Event Trigger 
Scripts and Callback Events</a></span>
<p class="body">Another way to extend the functionality of Content Server workflows 
is to create custom event trigger scripts that perform any operation when 
a specific workflow event occurs. For example, you can create
an event trigger script that automatically saves a workflow attachment as a 
new version of an existing Content Server document when the workflow is complete. 
You can also create event trigger scripts that monitor the work load 
of all workflow participants and assign a particular workflow step to the 
participant with the fewest steps.</p>

<span id="callback" class="title3">Understanding Callback Events in Content Server 
Workflow</span>

<p class="body">Callback event data is stored in special columns in the 
WAPI database tables. Each of these columns is also associated with a 
specific workflow event. For example, one column is associated with initiating 
a workflow, another is associated with deleting a workflow, another is associated 
with completing a workflow, and so on. When a Content Server user initiates the 
workflow, Content Server checks the WAPI database columns to 
determine if and when callback events should occur. The columns in the WAPI 
database table that store callback event data are identifiable because of 
their names,which all end in <span class="code">CB</span>.

<p class="body">If you want a callback event to occur when a 
specific workflow step becomes <span class="emph">ready</span>, you store the 
callback event data in the WAPI database table column that is
associated with a workflow step becoming <span class="emph">ready</span>. 
Then, when Content Server reaches that step in the workflow, the callback event occurs.</p>

<p class="body">When Content Server encounters callback event data in a WAPI 
database column, it calls a script that is stored in the 
<span class="code">WAPISESSION</span> object. This script examines the 
workflow event that triggered the callback event, and then calls another 
script named <span class="code">GenericCB()</span>.


<p class="body">The <span class="code">GenericCB()</span> script examines the 
callback event data that is stored in the corresponding column of the 
WAPI database table. This data must be formatted as a list of lists, where 
each sub-list contains two elements: an integer and the additional data that
is required to execute the callback event. The <span class="code">GenericCB()</span> 
script examines the integer element and does one of two things based on its value. 
If the integer is a value between 1 and 99 (signifying that the callback event 
is part of the Content Server Workflow module), a standard workflow operation is 
performed. If the integer is a value outside of this range 
(signifying that the script was added as a Workflow customization), the 
<span class="code">GenericCB()</span> script calls another script 
named <span class="code"> CustomCB()</span>, indicating that a custom 
callback event is present in the Content Server workflow.

<p class="body">The <span class="code">CustomCB()</span> script begins 
loading all of the custom objects that are registered in WAPI and 
calling their <span class="code">CBExecute()</span> scripts. When 
the <span class="code">CustomCB()</span> script calls a 
<span class="code">CBExecute()</span> script that matches the 
value of the integer associated with the callback event, it runs 
that <span class="code">CBExecute()</span> script and returns an 
<span class="code">Assoc</span>. The <span class="code">CBExecute()</span> script
performs the custom operations associated with the workflow step.
Note that one of the fields in the <span class="code">Assoc</span> 
is called <span class="code">Handled</span>. If <span class="code">Handled</span> 
is set to <span class="code">TRUE</span>, it indicates that the operation 
is being <span class="emph">handled</span> or performed. 
If <span class="code">Handled</span> is set to <span class="code">FALSE</span>, 
the process continues until the operation can be handled or performed.</p>

<span class="title3">Event Trigger Scripts</span>
<p class="body">If you want to use callback events to add functionality to Content Server, but you do not want to create a supporting interface -- or if you want to add functionality that does not require an interface -- you can use special classes of callback events called event trigger scripts. Event trigger scripts provide a preexisting interface to callback events in Content Server. When you add event trigger scripts to Content Server, this interface 
(the <span class="gui">Event Scripts</span> tab) becomes available to the Content Server user painting a workflow map, allowing that user to 
determine which operations to associate with the particular workflow events that occur in the execution of a workflow map.

<p class="body">There are three types of event trigger scripts: general event trigger scripts, performer event trigger scripts, and submap event trigger scripts. For more information about event trigger scripts, see 
<a href="eventtrigs.html">Adding Event Trigger Scripts</a>.</p>
