<p class="title">Variables</p>

<p class="body">Variables are named storage locations with values that can change. Variable names 
can contain letters, numbers, and underscore characters ( _ ), but must start with a letter. These 
names are <span class="emph">not</span> case-sensitive and can be no longer than 255 characters.</P>

<p class="body">Open Text recommends that you give your variables meaningful descriptive names; for example, variables named <span class="code">count</span>, <span class="code">contents</span>, and <span class="code">defaultValue</span> are more 
meaningful than variables named <span class="code">x</span>, <span class="code">y</span>, and <span class="code">z</span>. </P>

<p class="body">You cannot give your variables names corresponding to reserved words. Examples of 
reserved words include:</P>

<ul class="body">
<li>Control keywords (for example: <span class="code">end</span>, 
<span class="code">if</span>, <span class="code">while</span>)</P>
<li>Function keywords (for example: <span class="code">function</span>, 
<span class="code">return</span>, <span class="code">void</span>)</P>
<li>Data type keywords (for example: <span class="code">Integer</span>, 
<span class="code">String</span>, <span class="code">Real</span>)</P>
<li>Unprefixed constants (for example: <span class="code">FALSE</span>, 
<span class="code">TRUE</span>, <span class="code">IntegerType</span>)</P>
<li>Unprefixed built-in function names (for example: <span class="code">Echo</span>, 
<span class="code">Open</span>)</P>
<li>Built-in function package names (for example: <span class="code">Math</span>, 
<span class="code">Dialog</span>)</P>
<li>Operators (for example: <span class="code">and</span>, <span class="code">or</span>)</P></ul>

<p class="body">For a complete listing of OScript reserved words, see <a href="reserved.html"> 
<span class="emph">Reserved Words</span></a>. </P>
<p class="body">Any of these reserved words can be used as <span class="emph">part</span> of your variable name 
(for example, <span class="code">openPage</span> and <span class="code">ifExists</span> are valid variable names).</P>

<p class="subh2">Declaration</P>
<p class="body">A variable declaration associates a data type (for example: Boolean, File, String) 
with a variable. The declared variable can then assume a value of the specified type, Undefined, or 
Error.</P>
<p class="body">A variable declaration consists of a data type name followed by one or more 
spaces and/or tabs and a list (separated by commas) of one or more variable names of that type. A typical set of variable declarations might look like this:</P>

<pre>		Integer numberOfItems
		Boolean found, modified
		File libraryDoc, externalDoc</pre>

<p class="body">Variables should be declared before they are used. If you do not declare a 
variable, the OScript compiler implicitly assumes it to be <span class="emph">Dynamic</span>, allowing its type to 
change. The compiler performs no type checking on Dynamic variables.</P>

<p class="body">Variables can be initialized in their declaration. To specify an initial value in 
your variable declaration, follow the variable name with the OScript assignment operator and an 
initial value. For example:</P>

<pre>		Integer numberOfItems = 6
		Date rightNow = Date.Now()
		String strDate = Str.String( rightNow ) </pre>

<p class="body">If you attempt to assign a value to an undeclared variable, a warning message is 
generated when you compile the script, indicating that the variable has not been declared. If you 
do not correct this error, the compiler assumes you intended to create a new Dynamic local 
variable.</P>

<p class="body">Variable declarations can be placed anywhere in your script but are commonly 
found at the beginning of the script, making it easier to read.</P>

<p class="subh2">Scope</P>
<p class="body">The scope of a variable defines the range over which it is accessible. OScript 
allows you to define both local variables and global variables, each with a different scope.</P>

<p class="subh2">Local Variables</P>
<p class="body">Local variables are defined only within the script, function, or control statement 
in which they are declared. </P>

<ul class="body">
<LI>If a <span class="gui">script </span>contains a call to another script, the variables defined in the calling script are not accessible to the called script, and the variables defined in the called script cannot be 
accessed by the calling script.</LI></p>
<LI>If you create a <span class="gui">function</span>, the variables defined within the function are not accessible outside of the function and the variables defined outside of the function are not accessible by the 
function.</li></p>
<LI>If you declare a variable inside a <span class="gui">control statement </span>(a loop or conditional structure), the variable is not accessible outside of the loop, even if the statements are all part of the 
same script or function.</li></ul>

<p class="body">For example, if your script contains a call to another script:</P>

<pre>		Integer result
		result = CalledScript()</pre>

<p class="body">The variable <span class="code">result</span>, defined in the calling script, 
is not accessible to <span class="code">CalledScript</span>.</P>
<p class="body">Or, for example:</P>

<pre>		Integer	myNumber
		String	myText
		myText = subFunction()
		function void subFunction()
				...block of code...
		end<br></pre>

<p class="body">References to <span class="code">myNumber</span> or 
<span class="code">myText</span> from within the function 
<span class="code">subFunction</span> are invalid since they are defined outside of 
<span class="code">subFunction</span>. For more information about functions and how 
they are defined, see the <span class="emph">Functions</span> section.</P>
<p class="body">Or, for example:</P>

<pre>		Integer myNumber = 1
		while ( myNumber &gt; 20 )
			Integer	yourNumber = myNumber * 10
			myNumber += 1
		end</pre>

<p class="body">References to <span class="code">yourNumber</span> outside of the while 
loop are invalid since <span class="code">yourNumber</span> was declared inside the loop.</P>

<p class="subh1">Global Variables</P>

<p class="body">A global variable is accessible by all scripts. A global variable is not 
explicitly declared. It is created the first time a value is assigned to it, and exists for the 
duration of a program.</P>
<p class="body">Global variable names are prefaced with a dollar sign ($).</P>

<pre>		Integer myAge
		$globalAge = 25
		myAge = $globalAge + 10</pre>

<p class="body">There is no compile-time checking of either the type or existence of global 
variables. Exercise caution when using global variables.</P>
