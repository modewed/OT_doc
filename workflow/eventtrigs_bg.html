<p class="body"><p class="title">Adding Event Trigger Scripts: Background
Information</p>
 This section summarizes the features involved in creating <a href="#backgen">
general</a>, <a href="#backper">performer</a>, and <a href="#backsub">
submap</a> event scripts, along with how to <a href="#backrest">restrict</a>
access to event scripts.<br>
<br>
 <span id="backgen" class="title2">Background on General Event Trigger
Scripts</span></p>

<p class="body">Before you can create an event trigger script for the General
callback event, you must create an orphan of the <span class="code">
GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object, located in <span class="code">
WFMain:WFRoot:CallbackEventsScripts</span>, into your custom module. The <span
class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object contains the scripts that can
be attached to general workflow events. </p>

<p class="body">For each general event trigger script that you create, you can
set the following features:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li class="body"><span class="code">fEnabled</span>, which contains a Boolean
value. When set to TRUE, the fEnabled feature lets you register the object 
in WFMain:WFCBGeneralSubsystem.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li class="body"><span class="code">fScriptName</span>, which contains a String
value. This feature stores the name that you want to represent the event
trigger script on the Event Scripts tab in the Content Server interface. By default,
the name that you give to the script is used to name the option on the Event
Scripts tab in the Content Server interface; however, you can customize the name that
is displayed by creating this String feature.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">If the names of the scripts that you add to the <span class= 
"code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object do not begin with a 0 or an
underscore (_), they are displayed on the Event
Scripts tab in the Content Server interface as options for Content Server users to
attach to general workflow events. If the names of your scripts begin with a 0
or an underscore (_), they are not displayed in the Content Server interface, but can
be used as utility scripts that are referenced by the event trigger
scripts.</p>

<p class="body">If you attach a general event trigger script to a Step Ready
event and the event trigger script returns a value of <span class="code">
TRUE</span>, the step is automatically completed.</p>

<p class="body">After you set the features associated with the <span class=
"code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object, you can create the general event
trigger scripts. A prototype for the general event trigger scripts is stored in
the <span class="code">ODocumentation()</span> script in the <span class=
"code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object. General event trigger scripts must
return a Boolean value -- <span class="code">TRUE</span> for success or <span
class="code">FALSE</span> for failure.</p>

<p class="body">After you orphan the general event trigger object, set the
<span class="code">fEnabled</span> feature, and create the general event
trigger scripts, you run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> script in
the <span class="code">Globals</span> object of your custom OSpace and restart
the Content Server Builder to register your changes. The <span class="code">
BuildOSpace()</span> script registers the <span class="code">
GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object in <span class="code">
WFMain:WFCBGeneralSubsystem</span> and exposes the Event
Scripts tab in the Content Server interface.</p>

<p class="body">When you install the custom module in which the general event
trigger functionality is contained, you can view your changes in the Content Server
interface. The names that you specified in the <i><span class="code">
fScriptName</span></i> features of the <span class="code">
GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object are displayed as options in the lists
associated with general workflow events on the <span class="gui">Event
Scripts</span> tab.</p>

<p class="body">For <span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> attached
to Before Send On events in the <span class="gui">Event Scripts</span> tab:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li class="body">Before Send On events are designed for validation purposes, for
example to check if an attachment is reserved or not. For scalability reasons the
Before Send event scripts are executed without locking the process instance. They
are executed even if parallel paths or sub workflows are executed at the same time.
<br><br>
</li>

<li class="body">Only read-only operations are allowed, no modifications are
possible (e.g. on the work package) in <span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span>
referenced in the Before Send On callback.<br><br>
</li>

<li class="body">It is possible to set a specific error message. Use the
<span class="code">fErrorMsg</span> feature of the WSession to set
the desired error message in the general event script. For example:<br><br>
<span class="code">prgCtx.WSession().fErrorMsg = Str.Format( "The document %1
is reserved", documentName )</span><br><br> This error message is displayed in
case the <span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> returns 
<span class="code">FALSE</span> for failure.
</li>
</ul>

<span id="backper" class="title2">Background on Performer Event Trigger
Scripts</span>

<p class="body">Before you can create the event trigger scripts for the
Performer callback event, you must create an orphan of the <span class="code">
PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object in your custom module. You can find the
<span class="code">PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object in <span class=
"code">WFMain:WFRoot:CallbackEventScripts</span>. The <span class="code">
PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object will contain the scripts that can be
attached to the Assign Step Performer workflow event.</p>

<p class="body">For each performer event trigger script that you create,
you can set the following features.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li class="body"><span class="code">fEnabled</span> contains a Boolean value.
When set to TRUE, the fEnabled feature lets you register the object with 
WFMain:WFCBPerformerSubsystem.</li><br><br>

<li class="body"><span class="codevar">fScriptName</span>&nbsp; contains a String value.
This feature stores the name that you want to represent the event trigger
script on the Event Scripts tab in the Content Server interface. By default, the name
that you give to the script is used to name the option on the Event Scripts tab
in the Content Server interface; however, you can customize the name that is
displayed by creating this String feature.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">After you set the features associated with the <span class=
"code">PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object, you can create the performer
event trigger scripts. A prototype for the performer event trigger scripts is
stored in the <span class="code">ODocumentation()</span> script, which is
contained in the <span class="code">PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object. If
successful, these scripts return the ID of a Content Server user or group to which
the workflow step is assigned when it becomes ready; otherwise, these scripts
return errors.</p>

<p class="body">After you create and edit the performer event trigger scripts,
you must run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> script in the <span
class="code">Globals</span> object of your custom OSpace and restart the
Livelink Builder to register your changes. The <span class="code">
BuildOspace()</span> script registers the <span class="code">
PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object in <span class="code">
WFMain:WFCBPerformerSubsystem</span> and exposes the <span class="gui">Event
Scripts</span> tab in the Content Server interface.</p>

<p class="body">When you install the custom module in which the performer event
trigger functionality is contained, you can view your changes in the Content Server
interface. The names that you specified in the <i><span class="code">
fScriptName</span></i>&nbsp; features of the <span class="code">
PerformerCallbackScripts</span> object are displayed as options in the <span
class="gui">Assign Step Performer</span> list on the <span class="gui">Events
Script</span> tab. This lets you add performer event trigger scripts to Assign
Step Performer workflow events.</p>

<span id="backsub" class="title2">Background on Submap Event Trigger
Scripts</span>

<p class="body">Before you can create the event trigger scripts for the Submap
callback event, you must create an orphan of the <span class="code">
SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object in your custom module. You can find the
<span class="code">SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object in <span class="code">
WFMain:WFRoot:CallbackEventScripts</span>. The <span class="code">
SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object will contain the scripts that can be
attached to the Determine Sub-Map To Use workflow event.</p>

<p class="body">For each submap event trigger script that you create, you can
set the following features:</p>


<ul type="disc" class="body">
	<li class="body">fEnabled contains a Boolean value. When set to TRUE, the fEnabled
feature lets you register the object with the <span
class="code">WFMain:WFCBSubmapSubsystem</span>.<br><br>
	<li class="body"><span class="codevar">fScriptName</span>&nbsp;
contains a String value. This feature stores the name that you
want to represent the event trigger script on the Event
Scripts tab in the Content Server interface.
</ul>

<p>By default, the name that you give to the script is used to name the option
on the <span class="gui">Event Scripts</span> tab in the Content Server interface;
however, you can customize the name that is displayed by creating this String
feature.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="body">After you set the features associated with the <span class=
"code">SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object, you can create the submap event
trigger scripts. A prototype for the submap event trigger scripts is stored in
the <span class="code">ODocumentation()</span> script associated with the <span
class="code">SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object. If successful, these scripts
return an integer representing the MapID of a workflow map definition (as stored
in WAPI) that is initiated as a Sub-workflow when the corresponding step
becomes ready; otherwise these scripts return errors.</p>

<p class="body">After you create and edit the submap event trigger scripts, you
must run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> script in the <span class= 
"code">Globals</span> object of your custom OSpace, and restart the Livelink
Builder to register your changes. The <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span>
script registers the <span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object in
<span class="code">WFMain:WFCBSubmapSubsystem</span> and exposes the <span
class="gui">Event Scripts</span> tab in the Content Server interface.</p>

<p class="body">When you install the custom module in which the submap event
trigger functionality is contained, you can view your changes in the Content Server
interface.The names that you specified in the <i><span class="code">
fScriptName</span></i>&nbsp; features of the <span class="code">
SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object are displayed as options in the <span
class="gui">Determine Sub-Map To Use</span> list on the <span class="gui">Event
Scripts</span> tab. This lets you add submap event trigger scripts to Determine
Sub-Map To Use workflow events.</p>

<span id="backrest" class="title2">Restricting Access to Event Trigger
Scripts</span>

<p class="body">Creating event trigger scripts lets the creators of workflows
access the Event Scripts tab in the Content Server interface, where they can add
custom operations to specific workflow events. This means that the creators of
workflows can determine which operation to perform when a specific workflow
event occurs in the execution of a workflow.</p>

<p class="body">If you want to restrict access to an event trigger script that
you add to Content Server so that only certain Content Server users can attach the event
trigger script to specific workflow events, you can modify the <span class=
"code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and the <span class="code">
FactoryName()</span> script associated with the corresponding event trigger
object. For example, if you want to specify which Content Server users can attach a
general event script to specific workflow events, you can modify the <span
class="code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and the <span class="code">
FactoryName()</span> script contained in the general event trigger object in
your custom module. Similarly, if you want to specify which Content Server users can
attach a performer event trigger script to the Assign Step Performer workflow
event, you can modify the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and
the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script contained in the performer
event trigger object in your custom module. If you want to specify which
Content Server users can attach a submap event trigger script to the Determine
Sub-Map To Use workflow event, you can modify the <span class="code">
fObjectFactory</span> feature and the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span>
script contained in the submap event trigger object.</p>

<ul type="disc" class="body">
	<li class="body">fObjectFactory contains a Boolean value. 
	When set to TRUE, this feature works
with the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script to allow the Admin user (Content Server Administrator)
to restrict access to event trigger scripts.<br><br>
<li class="body">FactoryName() returns a string that identifies the event trigger scripts to
which you want to restrict access.
</ul>

<p class="body">You can restrict access to general event trigger scripts,
performer event trigger scripts, and submap event trigger scripts individually
by setting different return values for the <span class="code">
FactoryName()</span> scripts for each event trigger object. You can restrict
access to all general event trigger scripts, performer event trigger scripts,
and submap event trigger scripts together by setting the same return values for
the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> scripts for each event trigger
object.</p>

<p class="body">After you modify the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span>
features and the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> scripts contained in
the event trigger objects for the event trigger scripts to which you want to
restrict access, you must run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span>
script in the Globals object of your custom OSpace. Then, the <span class=
"code">Admin</span> user can go to the Administer Object and Usage Privileges 
section of the Content Server Administration page and specify which Content Server users can
attach the event trigger scripts to workflow events.</p>

<p class="body">Suppose that you create general, performer, and submap event
trigger scripts in your custom module and you want to restrict access to the
performer and submap event trigger scripts. You can set the <span class="code">
fObjectFactory</span> feature to <span class="code">TRUE</span> and modify the
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script to return the same string value
in the performer and submap event trigger objects. This means that the <span
class="code">Admin</span> user can specify which Content Server users can attach the
performer and submap event trigger scripts to workflow events. In this case,
certain Content Server users can attach the performer and submap event trigger
scripts to workflow events and all Content Server users can attach the general event
trigger scripts to workflow events.</p>
