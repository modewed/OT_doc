<p class="title">Adding New Data Types: Overview</p>

<p class="body">You add new data types (also called package types) 
to Content Server if you want to include new types of information in the 
work packages that accompany your workflows. By default, work packages can contain
three data types: attachments, attributes, and comments. However, you can 
create a data type for any new type of information that you want to add to a 
work package.</p>

<p class="body">
Adding new data types to Content Server also lets you customize the Content Server 
interface. For example, if the work packages that you include with 
your workflows usually contain many attributes, you can create a data type 
that creates the attributes and groups them on tabs in the Content Server 
interface. This makes it easy for workflow participants to locate and use the
attributes in the work package.</p>

<p class="body">You add new data types to Content Server by orphaning three objects:
<ul type="disc">
    <li class="body">The <span class="code">WFMain:WFRoot:WFObjectTypes:WFDataTypes</span> object is
    the API object for the task type.</p>
    <li class="body">The <span class="code">WebWFP:WebWFPRoot:WFPackage</span> object controls the 
    information required by the Workflow Designer to add the data type to a workflow map and to support
    the transport capability of Content Server.</p>
    <li class="body">The <span class="code">WebWork:WebWorkRoot:WFPackage</span> object controls the
    operation of the data type in executing workflows.</p>
</ul>
