<p class="title">Adding Event Trigger Scripts: Procedures</p>

This section contains procedural examples of creating 
<a href="#procgen">general</a>, <a href="#procper">performer</a>, and 
<a href="#procsub">submap</a> event scripts, along with how to 
<a href="#procrest">restrict</a> access to event scripts.
<br><br>

<span id="procgen" class="title2">Procedure for Creating General 
Event Scripts: Updating Workflow Attributes</span>

<p class="body">
This example describes how to create a general event trigger script that 
is used to update a workflow attribute. This general event trigger 
script walks through all of the different types of data that are flowing 
through the workflow (the work package) and locates the attributes RecArray. 
It then walks through all of the attributes in the RecArray, locates the one 
that you want to update, and updates the attribute by saving new data from the 
workflow.</p>

<span class="infin">To create the general event trigger script:</span>
<ol>
<li class="body">Orphan 
<span class="code">WFMain:WFRoot:CallbackEventScripts:GeneralCallbackScripts</span> 
in your custom module's OSpace, and name it 
<span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span>.</p>
<li class="body"> In the 
<span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object, set the value of the 
<span class="code">fEnabled</span> feature to <span class="code">TRUE</span>.</p>
<li class="body"> In the <span class="code">GeneralCallbackScripts</span> object, 
create a String feature, and name it
<span class="code">fChangeAttribute</span>.</p>
<li class="body"> Set the value of the 
<span class="code">fChangeAttribute</span> feature to 
<span class="code">Update Workflow Attribute</span>.</p>
<li class="body"> Create a script, and name it 
<a href="changeattribute.html"><span class="code">ChangeAttribute</span></a>.</p>
<li class="body"> In your custom module's 
<span class="code">Globals</span> object, run the 
<span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> script.</p>
<li class="body">Save and export your OSpace, and then restart the Livelink Builder.
</ol>

<p class="body">
The GeneralCallbackScripts object is registered in 
<span class="code">WFCBGeneralSubsystem</span>, and
the Event Scripts tab is exposed in the Content Server interface.

<p class="body">You have provided the information necessary to 
display the Update Workflow Attribute option on the Event Scripts tab in 
the Content Server interface. Now, you must provide the code that the 
<span class="code">ChangeAttribute()</span> script requires to perform 
the operation.</p>

<p class="body">You can use breakpoints to debug event trigger scripts in the same way
that you use breakpoints to debug other scripts in the Livelink Builder;
however, placing a breakpoint in an event trigger script always returns a
workflow error. Some calls in the event trigger scripts (especially those
that use WAPIWORK) will fail if you have added breakpoints. When you
finish debugging event trigger scripts, you must remove the breakpoints
that you have added.
<p class="body"> Another way to debug callback scripts is to send 
messages to the Builder's Debug window using the Echo function. For 
more information about the Echo function, see the 
<a href="../builder/frameset.html">Livelink Builder 
Developer's Guide</a>.</p>

<span id="procper" class="title2">Procedure for Creating Performer 
Event Scripts: Assigning Steps to Workflow Participants</span>

<p class="body">
This example describes how to create a performer event trigger script 
that is used to locate a workflow attribute named <span class="code">username</span>. 
This performer 
event trigger script locates the user associated with this attribute and 
assigns the next workflow step to them.</p>

<span class="infin">To create the performer event trigger script:</span>

<li class="body"> Set the value of the <span class="code">fChooseUser</span> 
feature to <span class="code">Choose User</span>.</p>
<li class="body"> In the <span class="code">PerformerCallbackScripts</span>

<span id="procsub" class="title2">Procedure for Creating Submap Event 
Scripts: Defining Sub-workflows On-The-Fly</span>

<p class="body">
This example describes how to create a submap event trigger script that 
is used to define a Sub-workflow map and save the map definition in 
WAPI. This map definition instructs Content Server to assign the same task 
to each Content Server user in the user list.</p>

<span class="infin">To create the submap event trigger script:</span>

</ol>
<p class="body">
The <span class="code">SubmapCallbackScripts</span> object is registered in 
<span class="code">WFCBSubmapSubsystem</span>, and the
Event Scripts tab is exposed in the Content Server interface.

<p class="body">You have provided the information necessary to display 
the Generate Sub-workflow option on the Event Scripts tab in the 
Content Server interface. Now you must provide the code that the 
<span class="code">subworkflow()</span> script requires to perform the operation.</p>

<span id="procrest" class="title2">Restricting Access to Event Trigger Scripts</span>

<p class="body">
Creating event trigger scripts lets the creators of workflows access 
the Event Scripts tab in the Content Server interface, where they can add 
custom operations to specific workflow events.
This means that the creators of workflows can determine which 
operation to perform when a specific workflow event occurs in the 
execution of a workflow.</p>

<p class="body">
If you want to restrict access to an event trigger script that you add 
to Content Server, you can modify the 
<span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and the 
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script associated with
the corresponding event trigger object. Similarly, if you want to specify 
which Content Server users can attach a performer event trigger script to the 
Assign Step Performer workflow event, you can modify the 
<span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and the 
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script
contained in the performer event trigger object in your custom module. 
If you want to specify which Content Server users can attach a submap event 
trigger script to the Determine Sub-Map To Use workflow event, you 
can modify the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> feature and the
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script contained in the submap
event trigger object.</p>

<ul type="disc" class="body">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> contains 
	a Boolean value. When set to TRUE, this feature works
with the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script to allow the Admin user (Content Server
Administrator) to restrict access to event trigger scripts.
<br><br>
<li class="body"><span class="code">FactoryName()</span> returns a string that 
identifies the event trigger scripts to which
you want to restrict access.
</ul>

<p class="infin">
To restrict access to event trigger scripts:</P>
<ol>
<li class="body"> Locate the event trigger object that contains the 
event trigger script to which you
want to restrict access in your custom module.<p></li>
<li class="body"> Set the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> 
feature to <span class="code">TRUE</span>.<p></li>
<li class="body"> Type the string value that you want to return in 
the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script.<p>
This string value is displayed in the Usage Privileges section of the 
Administer Object and Usage Privileges page.<p>
<dl class="body">
	<dt><span class="gui">Tip:</span><dd> Use the name 
	that you specified in the <span class="codevar">fScriptName</span>&nbsp; feature by
referencing that feature as<span class="codevar">.fScriptName</span>&nbsp; in 
the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script.</dl><p>
<li class="body"> In the <span class="codevar">modulename Globals</span> 
object, run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> script.<p></li>
<li class="body"> Save and export your OSpace, and then restart the 
Livelink Builder.</li></ol>

<p class="body">You can restrict access to general event trigger 
scripts, performer event trigger scripts, and submap event trigger 
scripts individually by setting different return values for the
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> scripts for each event 
trigger object. You can restrict access to all general
event trigger scripts, performer event trigger scripts, and submap 
event trigger scripts together by setting the same return values for 
the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> scripts for each event
trigger object.</p>

<p class="body">After you modify the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> 
features and the <span class="code">FactoryName()</span> scripts contained
in the event trigger objects for the event trigger scripts to which you 
want to restrict access, you must run the <span class="code">BuildOSpace()</span> 
script in the Globals object of your custom OSpace. Then, the 
<span class="code">Admin</span> user can go to the Administer Object and Usage Privileges 
section of the Content Server Administration page and specify 
which Content Server users can attach the event trigger
scripts to workflow events.</p>

<p class="body">Suppose that you create general, performer, and submap 
event trigger scripts in your custom module and you want to restrict 
access to the performer and submap event trigger
scripts. You can set the <span class="code">fObjectFactory</span> 
feature to <span class="code">TRUE</span> and modify the 
<span class="code">FactoryName()</span> script to return the 
same string value in the performer and submap event trigger objects.
This means that the <span class="code">Admin</span> user can 
specify which Content Server users can attach the performer and submap 
event trigger scripts to workflow events. In this case, certain Content Server users
can attach the performer and submap event trigger scripts to workflow events and all
Content Server users can attach the general event trigger scripts to workflow events.</p>
