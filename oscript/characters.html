<p class="title">Special Characters</p>

<p class="body">The OScript language contains several types of special characters to indicate 
particular types of text within a script. Special OScript characters are used to indicate the presence of 
comments and labels, to provide a method of line continuation, and to separate several statements 
that appear on a single line.</P>

<P class="subh1">Comments</P>
<p class="body">Comments are non-executable statements that help the reader of a script more 
readily discern its purpose. OScript supports two types of comments: ( // ) and the ( /* ... */ ) pair.</P>
<p class="body">The ( // ) comment character defines a single line comment. It can be used on a 
line by itself or it can follow another statement. For example:</P>

<pre>			// this is a whole line comment
			Integer x = 55 // this is an end-of-line comment</pre>

<p class="body">All characters on the line following the comment character are considered to be 
part of the comment and are, therefore, ignored by the compiler.</P>
<p class="body">The ( /* ... */ ) pair can be used to define a multiple line comment, although both characters 
can be placed on a single line also. For example:</P>

<pre>			/* 
			this is a 
			multiple line comment
 			*/
			Integer x = 55 /* this is an end-of-line comment */</pre>

<p class="body">All characters following the ( / * ) character and preceding the next ( */ ) 
character are considered to be part of the comment and are, therefore, ignored by the compiler.</P>
<p class="body">Comments are optional, but they provide a simple and straightforward method of 
documenting your script.</P>


<P class="subh1">Labels</P>
<p class="body">Labels are non-executable statements that allow you to mark a location in your 
script to which execution can be branched using the <span class="code">goto</span> control statement. 
A label:</P>
<ul class="body">
<li>Must be on its own line in a script.</li>
<li>Can include up to 32 alphanumeric characters and underscores.</li>
<LI>Must start with a letter.</li>
<LI>Is followed by a colon.</li></ul>

<p class="body">For example:</P>

	<pre>			String userName
			List userData
			File myFile = File.Open( &quot;C:\DATAFILE&quot;, File.ReadMode )
			userName = File.Read( myFile )
			if userName = ''
				goto error_routine
			else
				userData[ 1 ] = userName
			end
				...<i>block of code</I>...
			return
			<B>error_routine:</B>
			echo( 'You did not enter a valid value!' )</pre>


<p class="subh1">Statement Continuation and Termination</P>
<p class="body">The end-of-line character is the default statement delimiter. However, you may 
need to continue a statement to the next physical line, or want to place more than one statement on a 
single line.</P>
<p class="body">The continuation character is the back slash ( \ ). For example:</P>

	<pre>			Echo(&quot;x&quot;, \
			&quot;y&quot;, \
			&quot;z&quot;)</pre>

<p class="body">The compiler considers this to be one statement, even though it spans three 
physical lines.</P>
<p class="body">Comments can follow the statement continuation character, but the continuation 
character must <I>precede </I>the comment, for example:</P>

	<pre>			Echo(&quot;x&quot;, \
			&quot;y&quot;, \// this is the proper place for a comment
			&quot;z&quot;)</pre>

<p class="body">The continuation character cannot be used in the middle of a String 
declaration. For example:</P>

	<pre>			// error in the following statement:
			String s = &quot;The quick brown fox \
			jumped over the lazy dog.&quot;
			// error fixed in the following statement:
			String s = &quot;The quick brown fox&quot; + \
			&quot;jumped over the lazy dog.&quot;</pre>

<p class="body">The statement terminator is the semicolon ( ; ). For example:</P>

	<pre>			Integer lineCount, recCount
			lineCount = 1; recCount = 1 // initialize counters</pre>

<p class="body">In the above example, the compiler considers the assignments to be two separate 
statements even though they are on the same physical line.</P>
