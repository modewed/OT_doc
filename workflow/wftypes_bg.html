<p class="title">Adding New Workflow Types: Background Information</p>

<p class="body">You begin creating a new workflow type by orphaning the 
<span class="code">WFCustomScriptPkg</span> object, to act as a 
superclass object in your custom module's OSpace. You can find the 
<span class="code">WFCustomScriptPkg</span> object in
<span class="code">WFMain:WFRoot</span>.</p>


<p class="body">Because the <span class="code">WFCustomScriptPkg</span> 
object is a superclass object that can be used for many different workflow 
customizations, you create a child of the 
<span class="code">WFCustomScriptPkg</span>
object and use it to create each new workflow type.</p>

<p class="body">For each workflow type that you create, you can modify 
the following scripts:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetWFTypeName()</span> retrieves the name of the custom
	workflow type defined by the integer values of the 
	<span class="code">wfType</span> and <span class="code">wfSubType</span> 
	variables.  If the values of the <span class="code">wfType</span> 
	and <span class="code">wfSubType</span> variables correspond 
	to the values of the <span class="code">wfType</span> and 
	<span class="code">wfSubType</span> variables in the 
	<span class="code">GetWFTypes()</span> script, the corresponding 
	workflow name is assigned to the workflow type and a variable 
	named <span class="emph">handled</span> is set to 
	<span class="code">TRUE</span>. If the values of 
	the <span class="code">wfType</span> and 
	<span class="code">wfSubType</span> variables do not 
	correspond to the values of the <span class="code">wfType</span> 
	and <span class="code">wfSubType</span> variables in the 
	<span class="code">GetWFTypes()</span> script, a name is not 
	assigned to the workflow type and the handled variable is set 
	to <span class="code">FALSE</span>.</li></p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">GetWFTypes()</span> defines the type, subtype, and 
	name of the custom workflow types that you create. This script 
	returns a list of Assocs. Each Assoc contains an integer that
	specifies the type <span class="code">(wfType)</span>, an 
	integer that specifies the subtype 	<span class="code">(wfSubType)</span>, 
	and a string that specifies the name of the workflow type.</p>
	<li class="body"><span class="code">StartWF()</span> defines the changes that you 
	want to make to a particular workflow's map definition. This 
	script runs each time a workflow is initiated in Content Server. It
	does not apply to Sub-workflows.</p>
    <li class="body"><span class="code">ModifyOptions()</span> returns options that can 
    be defined for specific workflow packages. The script runs each time you start to modify a 
    workflow during execution or when you save your modifications. This allows you to configure
    different package behaviors during workflow modification depending on the workflow type.
</ul>

<p class="body">
After you orphan the <span class="code">WFCustomScriptPkg</span> 
object and modify the <span class="code">GetWFTypeName()</span>, 
<span class="code">GetWFTypes()</span>, and 
<span class="code">StartWF()</span> scripts, the Workflow Type list is 
exposed in the Content Server interface. This list is displayed 
on a workflow map's 
General Properties page and contains the names of the different types of 
workflows that you have created. The <span class="gui">Workflow Type</span> 
list lets the creators of workflow maps choose which type of workflow 
they want to create (that is, which custom operations they want to 
apply to their workflow map definition just before their workflow is initiated).
